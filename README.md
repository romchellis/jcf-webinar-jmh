**Benchmark Java Collections Comparison JMH**

This repository contains benchmarking classes for comparing the performance of different data structures in Java. Three main benchmarks are included:

1. **MapBenchmark:** Compares the performance of HashMap and TreeMap in terms of selecting ordered range of elements.
2. **ListBenchmark:** Measures the efficiency of removing elements from head ArrayList and LinkedList.
3. **ArrayTraversalBenchmark:** Evaluates the traversal speed of arrays by rows and columns.

Each benchmark utilizes JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) for accurate performance measurements. Results are outputted in JSON format for further analysis.

To run the benchmarks, execute the respective main methods in each class.
